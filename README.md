# Data Science Midterm Project

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to work with the housing data in the US and create supervized learning through ML. With results created from ML, we can fine tune and create efficient house price predictions.

## Process
### EDA
1. Load the data into a Panada dataframe
2. Explore, clean and preprocess the data for ML Modelling
3. Perform EDA on the data to understand the distributions and relationships between variables
   
### Model Selection
1. Use supervized learning models on your preprocessed data
2. Develop a criteria for model selection and justify
3. Explore feature selection and filter out features
   
### Tuning and Pipelining
1. Conduct hyperparameter tuning on your best performing models
2. Build a pipeline that performs your preprocessing steps and makes predictions using tuned model 

## Results
(fill in how your model performed)

## Challenges 
1. Lack of experience with GitHub requires more communication between team members which requires more time to get work done
2. 

## Future Goals
1. Gain more exposure to team work on GitHub
2. Use references from existing projects related to our project and improve our models
3.
